      <promptString>
        The user is querying the site {request.site} which has information about {site.itemType}s.
        Is the site utterly completely irrelevant to the user's query? 
        The question is not whether this is the best site for answering the query, 
        but if there is nothing on the site that is likely to be relevant for the query. 
        If the site is irrelevant, add an explanation for why it is irrelevant. Otherwise, leave that field blank.
